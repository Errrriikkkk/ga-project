This visualization is an auto-encoder run on rotated, black-white images from the data link provided.  I got the code for the autoencoder from DeepLearning.net, modified it to work on the data for this competition, and tweaked the number of output layers.

The summary of the algorithm, and the base code is available here http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/dA.html
