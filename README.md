# Algorithm
I'm working through the tutorials here http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/logreg.html starting from logistic regression, and moving into the Deep Learning classification problem.  The final goal of this project is to successfully run the deep learning tutorial on the galaxy data set, and understand at a high level exactly what the deep neural net is doing.
